                        <p class="miniH"> What is Dinozards? </p>

                        <p> 
                            Dinozards is a multiplayer arena game where up to four players battle each other free-for-all style. 
                            Players have three abilities at their disposal, a fireball, a reflect ability and a dash. Using them and position 
                            yourself favorably is the key to victory as the last player standing wins. The game also has a 2v2 mode for epic 
                            team battles.
                        </p>

                        
                        <p> 
                            This was a 7 week long school project I was apart of, together with 11 other people. The team consisted of 3 programmers, 
                            3 game designers, 6 artists. Our main goal was to create a simple, yet fun game given the seven week time frame. It’s 
                            very easy to overscope a project like this so we chose an idea that would allow plenty of time for polishing.                            
                                                   
                        </p>

                        
                        <p class="miniH"> What did I do during the project?</p>

                        <p>
                            
                            For this project I mainly worked on the input system, player movement, knockback and damage systems. I also took somewhat 
                            of a “lead programmer” role which mostly meant that I was the main person to talk to regarding gameplay systems and our 
                            general “code direction” for lack of a better term. 2 out of our 3 designers are also very technical, meaning we had 
                            effectively 5 people writing code. To keep the code consistent I wrote a coding standard document so everyone was on the 
                            same page.

                            Towards the end of the project I spent a lot of time looking at the Unity profiler to see if any performance optimizations
                            could be made. I was mainly looking for unnecessary instances of garbage collections, over use of GetComponent() or cases
                            of high CPU usage and the cause for it.
