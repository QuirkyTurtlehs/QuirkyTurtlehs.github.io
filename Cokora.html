                        <p>
                            Cokora is single player, story based puzzle game. The goal of the game is to traverse the level by platforming,
                            breaking and moving objects. The puzzles are designed with emergent gameplay in mind so that the player can
                            traverse in different ways.                               
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            This was a 4 week long school project I was apart of, together with 11 other people. The team consisted of 3 programmers, 
                            3 game designers, 6 artists. At first we decided that the player would have 3 abilities and we programmers would be 
                            responsible for one ability each. The 3 planned abilities were a dash, the ability to push objects and a Hover mechanic so 
                            the player would be able to hover across large gaps.                                                                                   
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was responsible for the hover mechanic, however the mechanic itself wasn’t very fun and created very 
                            boring level design which lead to It got scrapped half way through the project. It’s replacement was a world object with similar 
                            purpose (a sort of air geyser or updraft). Unfortunately for me, no code from the original hover mechanic could be reused and 
                            the new “updraft” mechanic was mostly made in blueprints due to time restrictions.                            
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The programmer responsible for the push ability experienced a similar thing to me, as the code for the push ability also got 
                            scrapped and the mechanic got baked into the dash ability.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Smaller stuff I partially worked on was basic player functionality (input, movement, jump ect) and the game settings for the 
                            in-game menu. I also made a flashlight mechanic while we were prototyping several different potential mechanics. We as a team 
                            eventually decided not not include this one.
