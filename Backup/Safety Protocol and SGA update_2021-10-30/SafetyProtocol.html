                            <!-- Safety Protocol is a narrative driven, environmental puzzle game that lets you explore an eerie space station while chatting with the stations AI. The main mechanic of
                            the game is the interactive power system. Hidden fuse boxes can be reactivated to increase your power supply which can then be used to power different areas inside the station. 
                            This is used to unlock new paths, letting you delve deeper into the story. -->

                            Welcome aboard the VASA Space Station. Restore the station's power supplies while uncovering what happened to the missing crew members.
                            <p></p>

                            Safety Protocol is a narrative driven, environmental puzzle game where you play as engineer Robert Walker, the new recruit of the VASA Space Station.
                            <p></p>

                            As you arrive at the space station, the power is out and the emergency lights are on. After managing to restore the power to a large console terminal, you discover an emergency chat system. The person on the other end aims to guide you through the station, in an attempt to restore its power little by little.
                            <p></p>

                            But where is the crew? What exactly happened to cause the power to go out in the first place? To find out what happened and why, you'll need to figure out how to distribute the station's power supply and reroute it to unlock new areas to explore. The further you get in your mission, the closer you also get to the truth. Are you prepared for what awaits you at the end?
                            <p></p>

                            This was a 7 week long student project I was apart of, together with 9 other people. The team consisted of 3 programmers, 
                            2 game designers, 5 artists. Our main goal was to create a simple, yet fun game given the seven week time frame. It’s 
                            very easy to overscope a project like this so we chose an idea that would allow plenty of time for polishing.
